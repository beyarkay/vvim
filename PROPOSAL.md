# Honours Project Proposal

- Current keyboards are sub-optimal, causing RSI and chronic wrist pain in many
  programmers
- This project proposes a more general suite of sensors that can measure the
  user's fingertip accelerations with high fidelity. 
  - With this platform, a model will be trained to recognise when the user is
    typing, and convert those fingertip accelerations into accurate keystrokes.
- This also has the possibility of forgoing the keyboard altogether, in favour
  of a more ergonomic input method.
  - Sign language is a possibility, however there will need to be enhancements
    for computer function keys (shift, control, alt, etc)
  - Converting the model from qwerty to Dvorak or another keyboard layout will
    be a trivial re-mapping.
  - Custom-designed input methods could also be investigated. These would be
    designed so as to keep the user's hands in a more ergonomic position.
- There is also strong potential in the VR/AR space, however that will likely
  be out of scope.
